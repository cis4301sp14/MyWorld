My World
===

This project is a social media site where friends can share pictures that have geotag locations.
With this site we were able to implement most of the features that we were envisioning for this 
project. As a group we only had a small experience with html and css and no experience with 
javascript, ajax, and php however we were able to learn these languages and the website was 
a success.
Bootstrap was very helpful in designing an aesthetically pleasing website. The code is not that 
clean but the functions work and we are very impressed that we were able to create a functioning 
social media site in a month or so.
